Lab 4: OSPF Single Area

Overview
In this lab, I configure Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) in a single-area design (Area 0) across multiple routers. The goal is to establish OSPF neighbor relationships, exchange routing information, and verify full network reachability using dynamic routing.

Objectives
- Set up a multi-router topology suitable for OSPF.
- Enable OSPF routing and advertise all relevant networks.
- Verify adjacency formation and routing table updates.
- Test connectivity across the OSPF domain.
- Document pre- and post-configuration states.

Tasks
1. Build the Packet Tracer topology.
2. Create the addressing plan.
3. Record baseline device status (pre-config verification).
4. Configure OSPF on all routers.
5. Verify OSPF neighbors, routing tables, and interfaces.
6. Perform end-to-end connectivity tests.
7. Generate the final report files for GitHub.

Deliverables
- `README.md` (this file)
- `addressing-table.md`
- `pre-config-verification.md`
- `ospf-configurations.txt`
- `post-config-verification.md`
- `final-lab-report.md`
