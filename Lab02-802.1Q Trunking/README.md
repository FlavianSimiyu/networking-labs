Lab 2: Router-on-a-Stick Inter-VLAN Routing (802.1Q Trunking)

Concept Demonstrated
Router-on-a-Stick (802.1Q Trunking) is a method of enabling inter-VLAN communication using a single physical router interface divided into logical subinterfaces. Each subinterface handles traffic for a specific VLAN using 802.1Q encapsulation. This lab demonstrates how switches use VLANs to segment networks and how a router provides Layer 3 routing between them through a trunk link.

Tasks to Be Completed
1. Create VLANs on the switch and assign ports to the appropriate VLANs.
2. Configure the switch–router link as an 802.1Q trunk.
3. Configure router subinterfaces, each mapped to a VLAN.
4. Assign IP addresses to router subinterfaces to serve as default gateways.
5. Configure PCs with correct IP addresses and gateways.
6. Test inter-VLAN routing and verify successful connectivity.
