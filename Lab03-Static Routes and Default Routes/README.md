Lab 3: Static Routing and Default Routes
Concept Demonstrated

This lab demonstrates how routers forward traffic to remote networks using static routes and default routes. You will configure multiple routers with directly connected networks and manually define routing paths so that all networks become reachable. The lab also shows how a default route provides a path for any unknown destinations by forwarding traffic toward an upstream router.

Tasks to Be Completed

Build a multi-router topology connecting at least two or three routers in sequence.

Assign IP addressing to all router interfaces and LAN segments.

Configure static routes to reach remote networks.

Configure a default route on one router to handle unknown networks.

Test connectivity using ping across all routers and LANs.

Verify routing tables using show ip route.
