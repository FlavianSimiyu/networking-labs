This repository contains a collection of hands-on networking labs completed using Cisco Packet Tracer and AWS Free Tier cloud resources.  
Each lab includes configuration files, diagrams, verification outputs, and documentation demonstrating practical networking skills.

The goal of this project is to build a strong, demonstrable portfolio of real-world networking configurations, troubleshooting, and documentation.
