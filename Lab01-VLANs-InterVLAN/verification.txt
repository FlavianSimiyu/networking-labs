Lab 01 – Verification Output

This file contains the key device verification commands and outputs captured from the Cisco 3560 multilayer switch used in Lab 01.  
These outputs confirm correct VLAN configuration, SVI status, interface assignment, routing behavior, and Layer 3 functionality.

Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP  
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area  
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2  
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, E - EGP  
       i - IS-IS, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2, ia - IS-IS inter area  
       * - candidate default, U - per-user static route, o - ODR  
       P - periodic downloaded static route  

Gateway of last resort is not set

C    192.168.10.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan10  
C    192.168.20.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan20

4. Interface Status Summary  
 Command: `show ip interface brief`

Vlan10                 192.168.10.1    YES manual up                    up

Verification Summary

All verification outputs confirm the following:

- VLANs 10 and 20 were successfully created and assigned to correct ports.  
- SVIs for both VLANs are up/up with correct IP addressing.  
- Layer 3 routing is operational with directly connected routes visible.  
- Routing table correctly reflects both subnets.  
- Inter-VLAN connectivity is fully functional.  

This concludes the verification section of Lab 01.
